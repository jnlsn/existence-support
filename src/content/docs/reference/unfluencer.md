title: Unfluencer
description: A social media personality that doesn't want your money.
---

Unfluencers are social media personalities that are not interested in your money, data, praise, or attention. A social media unfluencer may recommend products and services but will never ask for monetary support either directly or indirectly. A social media unfluencer is interested in your well being and is self aware enough to admit that their life philosophy is not universally applicable.

You should expect from an unfluencer:

- No affiliate links.
- No advertising.
- No sponsored content.
- No donations requests.
- No wasteful, profiteering merchandise.

In return you should:

- Buy any recommended services or products that you want from a local merchant or directly from the source.
- Question everything.
- Tell your friends. Or don't.
