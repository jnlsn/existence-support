description: Existence Support's guiding principles.
---

While Existence Support is meant to be applicable to all persons engaged in the pursuit of wellness, it is important to remember that we bring our own experience and history to the table. What works for us may not resonate with you. We like to think of ourselves as unfluencers. Our word is not scripture and we beg you to question everything. That said, there are three guiding principles behind our wellness philosophy.

## Be interested over interesting

Seek to engage with, understand, and enjoy your community and world. Love yourself without succumbing to narcissism. Continually expand your knowledge and experience at every opportunity. Remain open to new experiences. An interested person naturally becomes an interesting person.

## Ritual is greater than habitual

Habits are mindless activities we do to occupy ourselves. They are chores we work in to stay afloat. Sometimes they are necessary. We habitually brush our teeth. Other times they are draining. We habitually check social media. Rituals imply a certain intention setting that bring purpose and clarity to your daily affairs.

## Never settle for mediocrity

Not to be confused with perpetual unrest and dissatisfaction. Never settling for mediocrity is about developing rich friendships, rituals, and interests. It is about carefully allotting your valuable time to the things, people, and causes that matter most to you. That involves liberating yourself from the monotonous churn of the hyper-capitalist digital era.
